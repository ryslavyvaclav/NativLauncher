## Known Issues
1. I was not able to make `--widevine` working because I would have to [sign the app](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/1147#issuecomment-828750362).
   
   That means that certain websites wont work (Spotify, Tidal, and all those DRM Sites)
2. Webcam does not work
3. You tell me
